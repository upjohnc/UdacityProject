UdacityProject
==============

Class Project of lessons learned

This is the repository of the data analysis done for Udacity's Data Science certification.  It is a good test of visualizing data, finding actionable analytics, and explaining results.  All of which is based on two questions.  One - can management plan for entries into the Subway system based on time and day?  Two - can management plan for changes in entries based on measurable, predictable data, such as precipitation, temperature, etc.?
